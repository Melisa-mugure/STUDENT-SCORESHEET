Student Marksheet Management System – Java

This project is a Java-based Marksheet Generator designed to input student records, compute totals, assign grades, and generate a full class performance report.

The program uses arrays, loops, Scanner input, and conditional statements to simulate a simple academic record system.

Features
1. School Details Input

The teacher enters:

School Name

Teacher Name

Grade / Class

Year

These details appear at the top of the generated report.

2. Student Records Input

The system automatically expects data for 12 students.

For each student, the teacher enters:

Student Name

English marks

Math marks

History marks

Geography marks

Science marks

Programming marks

All marks are stored inside arrays.

3. Automatic Calculations

For every student, the program:

Calculates total marks

Assigns a rank/grade using this scale:

Grade Scale

Student Total Marks	Grade
540–600	A
480–539	B
420–479	C
360–419	D
Below 360	F
Class Statistics Computed

The program generates:

Total marks per subject

Overall total for all subjects

Subject averages

Number of A, B, C, D, and F grades in the class

Output Report

The program prints a neat table containing:

Student Name	English	Math	History	Geography	Science	Programming	Total	Rank

Followed by:

Totals row

Averages row

Grade distribution
